- Update booking statuses (accept/reject/complete)

### Technical Implementation
- Built with Spring Boot framework
- RESTful API architecture
- Pagination support for list endpoints
- File upload capabilities
- DTO pattern implementation
- Custom error handling with specific error codes

## Pagination Strategy

### Core Elements
- Default: 10 items per page, sorted by ID ascending
- Uses Spring Boot's `Pageable` interface and `@PageableDefault` annotation
- Returns `Page<T>` with data and metadata

### Current Implementation
- Applied to general advertisement listing and search results

### Technical Details
- Automatic URL parameter conversion to `Pageable`
- Response includes content, metadata, and navigation info
- Fixed sort by ID ascending

### Reliability Features
- Automatic parameter validation
- Consistent performance across varying data sizes
- Seamless integration with existing data retrieval methods
- Scalable design supporting future data growth

## Rate Limiting Strategy
### Core Elements
- Implements `Filter` interface for request interception
- Uses `ConcurrentHashMap` to track request counts per IP address
- Limits requests to 50 per minute per IP address

### Current Implementation
- Applied globally to all incoming HTTP requests

### Technical Details
- Utilizes `AtomicInteger` for thread-safe request counting
- Automatically initializes count for new IP addresses
- Increments request count for each incoming request
- Rejects requests exceeding the limit with 503 status code

### Reliability Features
- Thread-safe implementation using concurrent data structures
- Handles high concurrency with minimal performance impact
- Easily configurable request limit
- Scalable design supporting large number of unique IP addresses
